* Finish off Enter
* close-existing-tag should make use of insertTree now
* Modifier matching keys should work for all modifier keys
* Then get all the keys set up
* Backspace
* Selection (mouse and keyboard)

Keys that should be supported
 Bold, italic, underline,
 Strikethrough  Option + Shift + 5
 Superscript  ⌘ + .
 Subscript  ⌘ + ,
 choosing different css styles
 Text selection
* Technical issues that need to be solved: clicking on an element should represent a particular node (may need breaking apart a text node? or maintaining the current text in the current text node?).


* Grouping content: hr, pre, blockquote, ol, ul, li
* q, pre, code, samp, sup, sub, small, var, abbr
* q for quote: The q element must not be used in place of quotation marks that do not represent quotes; for example, it is inappropriate to use the q element for marking up sarcastic statements.
* figures?

=> h1–h6 elements must not be used to markup subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines unless intended to be the heading for a new section or subsection. 

Tests:
 * that there is an initial text placed
 * that pressing a character key enters it
 * that entering a command wraps the html.
 * ability to send a save request 
 * preventDefault, but only if we handled the event
 * don't handle keys which aren't known(e.g. Ctrl+R)
 * backspace
 * special characters: &amp; and < (maybe this is handled?)
 * aside, header, footer
* Modifier mappings add a tree of tags (e.g. ul > li)
* Modifier matching keys should work for all modifier keys
* Enter should do something different for li keys
* Tags-between does not include text nodes
* Closing a list removes a list item and opens a p
* Closing an empty list removes that entire list
* Closing an empty flow element removes it, except for p elements
